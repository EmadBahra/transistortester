\begin{enumerate}
\item The measurement results of little capacity values vary with the Pin combinations. Combination 1:2 values are about 3pF less than the values of the other pin combinations  (1:3 and 2:3). This effect is equal on any tested AVR processor.
\item Germanium Diodes (AC128) are not detected in all cases.
\item Does program work correctly without the automatic shut off?
\item The shown Pin numbers of resistor measurement are sometimes identical and stay in this error state until power is switched off
(Version 0.95k).
\item Capacitors with values of more than 40mF are detected as resistors with a value of \(2\Omega\).
Because resistor is detected first, capacity measurement is not done. More practical capacitors normaly have
values of 10mF or below. So if this problem can not be solved, capacity measurement can also be limited to
40mF instead of the aspired 100mF top value.

\section{Circuit of the TransistorTester}
The circuit of the TransistorTester in figure \ref{fig:ttester} is based on the circuit of
 Markus F. released in Abb. 1 of AVR-Transistortester report \cite{Frejek}.
Changed or moved parts are marked with green color, optional parts are marked with red color.
Some changes are made because the electronical power switch make problems in some implementations.
Therefore the resistor R7 is reduced to \(3.3k\Omega\). The capacitor C2 is reduced to
10nF and R8 is moved so that the PD6 output does not try to switch the C2 capacitor directly.
 Additional blocking capacitors are added and should be placed
near the power connection of the Atmega and near the Voltage regulator.
Because the PD7 input and PC6 (RESET) are the only pins, where pull up resistors where
needed, one extra \(27k\Omega\) resistor is added to the PD7 (pin 12) input. With this modification
the software can disable all internal pull up resistors of the ATmega.
The additional crystal with its 22pF capacitors are optional added. 
The accuracy of a crystal has the benefit of more stable time measurement for getting the
capacitor values.
New software version can use a scale switch of the ADC. The speed of switching is reduced
by the external capacitor C1 at the AREF (21) pin of the ATmega. To avoid slowing down the
measurement speedi more than necessary, the value of this capacitor should be reduced to 1nF.
Removing of the capacitor C1 is also possible.
For adapting the software to the actual circuit take a look to the Makefile options in the
configuring chapter \ref{sec:config}. Some different versions of R11 / R12 resistor combinations circulates
in the internet. I~have adapted my software to the original of Markus F. \cite{Frejek} with \(10k\Omega\) and \(3.3k\Omega\).
The additional 2.5V precision voltage reference connected at pin PC4 (ADC4) is planned to use
with future software versions and is currently not used.
A optional ISP connector has been added to easier load new software versions to the tester.

\section{Hints for building the TransistorTester}
Every LCD-display with at least 2x16 character and a HD44780 compatible controller
can be used with the TransistorTester. You should respect the current needed for
illumination, some LCD need lower current than others.
I had tried OLED type displays, but this type cause interference with measurements
of the ATmega and are {\bf not} recommended.
The resistors R1 to R6 are critical for measurements and this \(680\Omega\) and
\(470k\Omega\) resistors should be measurement type resistors (tolerance of 0.1\%) to
get the full accuracy.
You should use a precision socket for the ATmega microcontroller to enable
the replacement of the microcontroller.
The microcontroller ATmega8, ATmega88, ATmega168 and ATmega328 can be used.
Recommended is a ATmega168 or ATmega328, if you wish to use all features.
Anyway you should assemble all parts to printed board without the microcontroller.
A up-to-date low voltage drop regulator like MCP1702-5002 is recommended as IC2, because it
need only \(2\mu A\) of standby current and can still deliver 5V, if your input
voltage is only 5.4V. But this part is not pin compatible to well known 78L05 with TO92 body!
After checking, that all needed parts are at the correct place, you should
first connect the battery or power supply to the printed board without LCD-display
and microcontroller. You should check the voltage at the power pins of the
microcontroller and LCD-display terminal during the Test key is pressed.
The voltage should disappear, if you release the Test key.
If the voltage had correct polarity and value,
you should disconnect the power and assemble the microcontroller with correct
alignment. Be careful and make shure, that all pins of the microcontroller
are in the socket holes.
Now you can also connect the LCD. Check if power pins of the LCD has the right connection to
GND and VCC of your board. If you are shure that everything is all right, reconnect the power. 
If you have already programmed the ATmega, you can press the Test button.
By pressing the Test key, the background light of the LCD should switch on.
If you release the Test button, the LED should illuminate weak.
Notice, that the software for the microcontroller must be compiled for the
correct processor type. A program for the ATmega8 does not run on a ATmega168!

\section{Programming of the microcontroller}
I release the software for the microcontroller with source code.
The developement is done with Linux operationg system (Ubuntu) and
is controlled with a Makefile. The Makefile makes shure, that your
software will be compiled with the prior selected Makefile options. Some constellations
are precompiled with the source. Please take a look to the ReadMe.txt file
in the directory Sourcecode/default and to the chapter~\ref{sec:config}.
The result of compilation have the extensions .hex and .eep .
Usually the names will be TransistorTester.hex and TransistorTester.eep .
The .hex file contains the data for the program memory (flash) of the ATmega processor.
The .eep file contains the data for the EEprom memory of the ATmega. Both data files
must be loaded to the correct memory. Additionally the operating state of the
ATmega processor must be programmed with the ``fuses''.
If you can use my Makefile and additionally the program avrdude, you need no exact
knowledge of the details about the fuses. You have only to type ``make fuses'' if you
have no crystal or ``make fuses-crystal'' if you have installed the 8MHz crystal to your printed board.
With the ATmega168 series of the microcontroller you can also use ``make fuses-crystal-lp'' to use
a crytal with the low power mode.
Never choose the crystal mode of clock generation, if you don't have installed
the 8MHz crystal. If you are not shure with the fuses, leave them as default
set by manufactor and first bring the the tester to operation in this mode.
Maybe your program runs too slow, if you use program data compiled for
8MHz operation, but you can correct this later! But a wrong set of fuses may inhibit
later ISP-programming.

\section{Troubleshooting}
In most cases of problems you will miss the text output to the LCD-display.
At first you should check, if the LED was illuminated weak, if you release
the Test button. 
\begin{description}
\item[Power does not switch on.]
If the LED is without light and the VCC power has correct
5V voltage during holding the Test button, the microcontroller does not switch the power
correctly. The microcontroller should hold the power by switching the
PD6 output to 5V, which is usually done as one of the first actions.
If you hold the Test key pressed, the power is switched on anyway.
So you can check the value of VCC power and additionally the voltage value
of the PD6 output, if you hold the key pressed.
If VCC voltage has correct value (5V), but PD6 voltage is
below 4V, your microcontroller does not start the program. In this case
you should check if the microcontroller flash has been loaded with proper data for your
installed type and if ATmega is correctly configured with the fuses.
If your ATmega put the PD6 output to 5V and the power does not stay if you
release the Test key, it is more difficult to find the reason.
First you can shorten the LED and try again. If your Tester now starts,
your LED may be faulty or mounted with wrong polarity. If this is not
the reason, the current amplification factor of your T3 transistor (BC557C)
is insufficient. The current to the base of T3 is lower in the microcontroller
state as in the ``key pressed'' state.
\item[Nothing is readable on the LCD display]
Check the voltage at the contrast Pin at the LCD display (pin 3). Adjust to
correct value specified in the data sheet of your display and optimize by viewing.
If you have a high temperature display type, you must provide a negative contrast voltage
for operation. In this case you can use the ICL~7660 device for generating
a negative voltage from positive 5V.
If there is no output readable on the LCD and the background light is on,
you should disconnect the power and check all four data plus the two control signal connections.
If all connection are well, the only reason I see is a uncorrect timing of
control signals. This can be caused by a slower LCD controller than expected by
the software or the ATmega software runs at wrong clock speed. Please check for which
clock speed your programming data was compiled  and if the fuses of the
ATmega are correct set to that speed. You find the clock parameter in the corresponding
Makefile.
\item[Something but not all is readable on the LCD display]
Check if the .eep data are loaded to the EEprom memory of ATmega.
If all data are loaded correctly, you should check the clock speed of your
programming data (Makefile) and ATmega processor settings (fuses).
\item[Measurement is slow and Capacitors are measured about 8 times too small]
You run software compiled for 8MHz clock at real clock speed of 1MHz.
Please set the fuses of the ATmega correctly.
\item[Measurement has strangely values]
Check if your programmer is still connected to the ISP-plug.
The ISP interface should be disconnected for measuring.
Very often the reason of wrong measurements is the use of software compiled with
the AUTOSCALE\_ADC option and with the option NO\_REF\_CAP, but the capacitor
at the AREF pin has still a value of 100nF.
Wrong assembly of components or remaining soft solder flux can disturb the 
measurements too. Please check with the selftest function of your TransistorTester software
if possible. For the details see Chapter \ref{sec:selftest}.
Otherwise inspect your board visually and check the resistor values
with a ohmmeter. You can use the pins of the ATmega for this check, for example
to check the R1 you can measure between pin 23 and pin 14. Take a look at the
circuit diagram \ref{fig:ttester} for details. There is no need to
remove the microcontroller, only battery or power supply should be removed before.

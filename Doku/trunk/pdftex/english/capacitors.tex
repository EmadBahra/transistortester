\section{Measurement of Capacitors}
The measurement of capacitor values are done as separate task by measurement of load time
after all other measurements. 
The original software of Markus F. did this with a program loop, which reads the corresponding digital input
pin until a switch occured and count the loop cycles.
This has the handicap, that the resolution of time measurement is limited by the
time consumption of one loop cycle.
This usually was done in all six combinations for all three probe pins. 
The actual software uses two different ways to get the load time in only
three combinations for the three probe pins. The positive side is now always the
higher probe number. Only if capacity is measured parallel with a diode, the
polarity can be in the other order.

\subsection{Discharging of Capacitors}
You should always discharge the capacitor before connecting it to the tester.
The tester additionally discharge the capacitor before any measurement.
If the voltage is below 1300mV, the capacitor is shortened by the output pins of the connected ADC port (Port C).
I~believe that this is legal because every output port has a built in resistance of about \(20\Omega\).
The data sheet Figure 149 (page 258) \cite{ATmega8} shows voltage drop of output pins up to 2V.
Of course I can not guaranty, that no damage can occur. 
I~have tested the function with a 15mF Capacitor many times and I~have never noticed any problem.
The current should be below the specified limit of 40mA and is reduced fast by discharging.
Off course damage can occur if you do not discharge a (high voltage) capacitor before connecting it to your tester.

\subsection{Measurement of big Capacitors}
\label{sec:bigcap}
One side of the capacitor is connected to GND. The other side of the capacitor is connected with the
\(680\Omega\) resistor to VCC for a period of 10ms. Afterwards this probe pin is switched to Input (High Impedance).
After this 10 ms current pulse the voltage of the capacitor is measured without any current. If the voltage has not
reached a minimal value of 300mV, the load pulse is repeated up to 499 times.
If after 127 pulses a minimum voltage of 75mV is not reached (about 2s), further load is stopped, because never
the 300mV can be reached with the remaining load pulses.
Figure~\ref{fig:bigcap} shows the three phases of measuring the capacity value of a capacitor.
The value of the capacity is then computed with the count of load pulses and the reached load voltage from a table.
The table contains  the factors to get the capacity in nF units from load time and the reached voltage
with a spacing of 25mV.
Interim value of voltage will be interpolated.

\label{fig:bigcap}
\end{figure}
As a result of the low load voltage, the measurement is much faster than the initial software version,
 because this advantage works also on discharging. So bigger capacitors can be measured.
Furthermore a diode, which is parallel connected to the capacitor donÂ´t disturb the measurement in most cases,
because the flux voltage of most diodes is not reached.
Figure~\ref{pic:c229} shows the charge and discharge for a \(229\mu F\) capacitor.
The flat top of diagram from load end to discharge begin is caused by the measuring and computing time of the ATmega.
Figure~\ref{pic:c5mF} shows the same measurement for a~\(5mF\) capacitor,
notice how the time for measurement is grown to about 1.5 seconds inclusive the discharge. 
The last example shows the capacity measuring of a~\(15mF\) capacitor in Figure~\ref{pic:c15mF}

\subsection{Measurement of small Capacitors}
If the first 10 ms load pulse has overloaded the capacitor, another technique of measurement is used.
The ATmega processor has a build in 16-Bit counter, which can operate at the full clock rate (1MHz or 8MHz).
This counter has also the feature to save his counter value by a external event.
This event can be built by the output of the comparator. 
The comparator can operate with any ADC input pin and the band gap reference.
Figure~\ref{fig:comparat} shows a simplified diagram of the measurement situation.
So I discharge the capacitor, prepare the comparator to the proper pin input, start the counter at 0 and
start immediately the charging of the capacitor with one side connected to GND and the other side connected with
the \(470k\Omega\) resistor to VCC.
Now I check within a program loop, if the counter flags signals a overflow event or a input capture (external) event.
I count the overflow events until I detect the input capture event.
In this case I stop the counter and check if I must count a additional overflow,
because the counter can't be stopped by the input capture event.


The input capture counter and the overflow counter built together the total time,
from which I subtract a experimental find out constant to eliminate the measurement offset. 
I don't know, if this constant must be adapted to other printed circuit boards.
The actual software can use a table with the theoretical  dependency of the load time in respect to the comparator voltage.
The table is spaced in 50mV steps and will be interpolated according to the actual reference voltage. 
This table will only be acticated with the Makefile option WITH\_AUTO\_REF.
I noticed that the reference voltage is permanently somewhat to low,
 so that you can choose an offset with the Makefile option REF\_KORR.
The measured reference voltage will then be corrected (added) by your value (mV units).
If option WITH\_AUTO\_REF is not used, the reference voltages of ATmega8, ATmega88, ATmega168 and ATmega328
are applied as noted in the data sheets~\cite{ATmega8}~\cite{ATmega168}. 
A sample measurement of this type is shown in figure~\ref{pic:c22uF}.
The measurement time is above 2.6s because the \(470k\Omega\) is
used for charging, but discharge is in this case much faster than charging.

    \includegraphics[]{../PNG/charge_22uF.png}
  \caption{Charge and discharge of a \(22\mu F\) Capacitor for measuring}
  \label{pic:c22uF}
\end{figure}


In principle this technique of measurement can also be done with the \(680\Omega\) resistor, but 
because the ADC can't be used if the comparator is working, I have no chance to monitor the
load voltage until the comparator is stopped. If a undetected diode is parallel connected with
the capacitor, the load current of the capacitor can be absorbed by the diode (threshold voltage) and
the band-gap voltage will never be reached.
The method taken in actual software for big capacitors in section~\ref{sec:bigcap}
avoids this conceptual bug.

\subsection{Results of Capacitor measurement}
The results of my measurements is shown if figure~\ref{fig:mega8cap} for ATmega8 processor without and 
with the AUTOSCALE\_ADC option. Additionally some values of original software are shown with a correction factor
of 0.88 (-12\%).
The results of the measurement of the same capacitors for ATmega168 is shown in figure~\ref{fig:mega168cap}.
The reference for the error computing is the measurement of a PeakTech 3315 multimeter, not the printed value
of the parts. In future I hope to take the measurements of a PeakTech 2170 RCL-meter as more exactly
base values.
There is a trend in relative errors with the big capacitor measurement, which I can't explain.
I hope, that I will find the reason for this.

The differences of measurements of three different ATmega168 processors are shown in figure~\ref{fig:mega168all} .
The same results of three different ATmega168A processors are shown in figure~\ref{fig:mega168Aall} .
At this only the zero value of the capacity measurement of 39pF is respected, all other facility to correct the results are
not used.
This zero value includes the 2-3pF, which are caused by the 12 cm long cable with the clips.
The board layout can cause a different zero value, I have fixed this zero value with the board ''DG2BRS V 5.2.1''.

To get the best accuracy you must adapt the software to the individual characteristic of your ATmega exemplar.
For this you can set a correction voltage REF\_C\_KORR for the comparator, which will be used for measurement of little capacity values.
A correction of 1~mV will reduce the measurement results to 0.1~\% .
For big capacity values you can specify with the per mill value C\_H\_KORR, how much your capacity values are measured too big.
Because the capacitors with big values are most electrolytic capacitors with worse quality factor, the measurement of
the capacity value is difficult. So it is also extra difficult to get the difference to the real value of a measurement.

Especially with the ATmega168 processors I have noticed a anomaly of measurement results of little capacity values,
which depend on the slew rate of the voltage during loading of the capacitor.
Figure~\ref{fig:mega168optcap} shows the error of the capacity measurement when only the zero value is respected
(168-3-A), with correction factor for little capacitors REF\_C\_KORR=66 as well as the correction factor for big
capacitors C\_H\_KORR=50 (168-3-B), plus additional as gradient 168-3-C  with a model of the slew rate dependency of little capacitor 
measurements (COMP\_SLEW1=4000 und COMP\_SLEW2=220). Also the self-discharge of big capacitors is respected with gradient 168-3-C.
The component with the slew rate dependent value is computed with \(\frac{COMP\_SLEW1}{cval+COMP\_SLEW2} - \frac{COMP\_SLEW1}{COMP\_SLEW2}\),
where cval is the measured capacity value with pF units.

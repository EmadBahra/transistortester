\chapter{Known errors and unsolved problems}
{\center Software Version 0.98k}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Germanium Diodes (AC128) are not detected in all cases.
\item The shown Pin numbers of resistor measurement are sometimes identical and stay in this error state until power is switched off
(Version 0.95k).
\item Capacitors with values of more than 40mF are detected as resistors with a value of \(2\Omega\).
Because resistor is detected first, capacity measurement is not done. More practical capacitors normaly have
values of 10mF or below. So if this problem can not be solved, capacity measurement can also be limited to
40mF instead of the aspired 100mF top value.
\item Discharging of capacitors does not end regular. One user had reported to me, that a ATmega8 processor could not
find the end of discharge in the AUTOSCALE\_ADC mode.
The voltage limit for discharged capacitor ist set very low to below 3mV. My own tests with different processors are all well.
The appearance of this error is, that the tester wrote after a long time of about 12s the text ``Cell!'' to the LCD.
You can adjust the CAP\_EMPTY\_LEVEL in the Makefile to a higher level of 3mV, if you can not find the reason!

\end{enumerate}

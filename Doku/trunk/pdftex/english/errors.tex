\begin{enumerate}

\item Germanium Diodes (AC128) are not detected in all cases.

\item Capacity value in reverse direction for Power Schottky Diodes such as MBR3045PT can not be measured,
if only one diode is connected. The reason is a too big residual current of this diode.
Sometimes the measurement is possible by cooling down the device (with  cooling spray for example).

\end{enumerate}

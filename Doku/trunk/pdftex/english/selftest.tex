\section{Selftest Function}
\label{sec:selftest}
Beginning with release 0.9k I have implemented a self test function. Usage is very simple.
If you have installed  test terminal with clamps, put all clamps together to a piece of uninsulated wire and press the start button.
The program notice the shorten probes and start the self test function.
After finishing the self test the transistor tester will continue with normal measurement.
If no equipment is connected, the program will end with ``part unknown or damaged''. 
The unhappy side of the self test function is that the 8K flash is used near the limit.
The length of the ATmega8 version 0.9k is about 8000 bytes.
You can configure self test only together with all other options for a ATmega168  or ATmega328.
For the ATmega8 you must at least omit the option AUTOSCALE\_ADC because of the limited flash memory.
The separate steps of the self test function is generally displayed on row~1 of the LCD display with the letter T
followed by the step number.
Every step is repeated 8~times, before the program continues with the next step.
But if you hold the start key pressed, when the test is finished, this test is not repeated any more.
If you leave the key pressed the total time, every test is executed only once.

In every step only measurement results are displayed, no error analysis are done, you must interpret the results yourself.
At this place I will give you an additional important hint. Never do a measurement with connected ISP plug!
The ISP interface influences the measurement.

Here is the list of currently implemented tests:
\vspace{1cm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Measurement of the 1.3V (or 1.1V) reference Voltage (band gap Reference).}
In row 1 the text ``Ref='' and the measured Voltage in mV is displayed.
For the ATmega8 the voltage should be near to 1.3V. For the other processors the voltage should be near to 1.1V.
The second row shows the resulting factor for the capacity measurement with the \(470k\Omega\) resistor.
\item {\bf Comparing of the  \(680\Omega\) resistors.}
In row~1 the cryptic text  ``+RL- 12 13 23'' is shown. Meaning of this is as follows: 
The RL is the short form of Resistor Low meaning the \(680\Omega\) resistors. The 12 stand for: 
resistor at pin~1 is connected to VCC (+) and resistor at pin~2 is connected to GND (-). 
The result of this measurement  is displayed in row~2 at the first place. 
 In row~1 follows now a ``13'' which means, that the first connection of measurement~1 is still connected
with \(680\Omega\) to VCC but that the resistor of pin~3 is connected to GND.
The result is displayed in the middle place of row~2. 
The last measurement of this test ``23.'' means that now the resistor at pin~2 is connected to VCC (+) and
the resistor of pin 3 is connected to GND. The result of measurement is displayed at the last place of LCR row~2.
Please remember, that the resolution of the ADC is about 4.88mV!
The measurement situation is also shown in figure~\ref{fig:test2}.
All these combinations with respect to the internal resistance of the pins should result to: 
\(\frac{5001 \cdot  (19+680)}{ (19+680+680+22)} = 2493\) .

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=17cm]{../FIG/Test2.eps}
\caption{Comparison of \(680\Omega\) resistors }
\label{fig:test2}
\end{figure}

\item {\bf Comparing of the \(470k\Omega\) resistors.}
Now the display shows in row 1 ``+RH- 12 13 23''. The same procedure as done in step~2 is repeated with the \(470k\Omega\) resistors (symbols RH).
Result should be nearly \(\frac{5001 \cdot (19 + 470000]}{ (19 + 470000 + 470000 + 22)} = 2500\) for all combinations.
\item In this step nothing is measured, but the {\bf order is displayed „ isolate Probe“},
which means that it is time to separate the probes (release from wire).
\item {\bf This step tests the capability of GND (-) connected \(470k\Omega\) resistors (H) to pull the test pins to GND.}
Row 1 shows the text  ``RH-''.
Row 2 should display zero for all three pins.
\item {\bf This step tests the capability of VCC (+) connected \(470k\Omega\) resistors (H) to pull the test pins  to VCC (+).}
Row 1 shows the text ``RH+''.
The best value for this three measurements  is 5001.
 Great differences from the best value for test 5 and 6 are errors  such as isolation problem, flux material or damaged port.
\item {\bf Measuring of internal resistance of pin output switched to the GND signal.}
The text in the 1st LCD row is ``Ri\_Lo = (mV)''.
In the second row of the LCD three voltages were displayed.
The internal resistance of the port C outputs switched to GND (-) are measured with the current
of to VCC (+) switched \(680\Omega\) resistors, see Figure~\ref{fig:test7}.
Only the three pins of the ADC port are measured, the resistor port B (PB0,PB2 and PB4) can not be measured
without hardware modification.
Is is assumed that the port resistance of the different ports are nearly identical.
To get the resistor values, you must divide the displayed mV values by about 7 (see test 8). 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[]{../FIG/Test7.eps}
\caption{Measurement of internal resistance of Port C switched to GND }
\label{fig:test7}
\end{figure}

\item {\bf Measuring of internal resistance of port outputs switched to the VCC (+)signal.}
The needed current is generated with to GND connected \(680\Omega\) resistors .
The text in the 1st LCD row is ``Ri\_Hi= (mV)''. In the second row of the LCD three voltages are displayed (in difference to VCC).
It are the same measurements as those in test~7 to the other side as you can see in Figure \ref{fig:test8}.
With the following steps you can get the resistance:
To get the current build:  \((5001 - (result of test 7) - (result of test 8)) / 680\).
Then you can get both resistor values by dividing the voltage (result of test~7 or 8) by this current.

\includegraphics[]{../FIG/Test8.eps}
\caption{Measurement of internal resistance of Port C switched to VCC }
\label{fig:test8}
\end{figure}

\item {\bf Measurement of the zero value of the capacitor measurement.}
The zero value for the capacity measurement with pin combinations 1:3, 2:3 and 1:2 is shown in that order.
Alls three values are shown in pF units.
The normal output of capacity measurement will respect a default zero offset of 39 pF.
But for this results is no correction respected, no zero offset is subtracted.

\item A {\bf 50Hz rectangle signal} is generated on Pin~2 and  the same signal in opposite direction on Pin~3.
Pin~1 is switched to GND . The current is limited with \(680\Omega\) resistors.
This test is repeated 8~times with 5~seconds period each.
You can check the time of the wait calls, if you have an oscilloscope or frequency counter.
If you don't use the crystal clock version, the result may be inexactly.
A exactly clock frequency and wait time are important for measurement of capacity values.

\end{enumerate}

At the end of test function the text ``Auto Test End''  is shown in row~1 and the version number of software is shown in row~2.
Then the program continues with the normal measurement task.

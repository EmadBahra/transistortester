\begin{enumerate}

\item Germanium Diodes (AC128) are not detected in all cases.

\item Capacity value in reverse direction for Power Schottky Diodes such as MBR3045PT can not be measured,
if only one diode is connected. The reason is a too big residual current of this diode.
Sometimes the measurement is possible by cooling down the device (with  cooling spray for example).

\item Here and there  a wrong detection of the 2.5V precision referenz is reported, when the PC4 pin (27) is unconnected.
You can avoid this behaviour with a additional pull up resistor connected to VCC.

\item Sometimes a problem with the Brown Out level of 4.3V is reported for ATmega168 or ATmega328 processors.
This will cause a reset during capacity measurement. A reason is not known.
The Resets will disappear, if the Brown Out level is set to 2.7V.

\end{enumerate}
